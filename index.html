		<p>Ready to learn about version control through git?  You can 
		<a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Practicing_Git/Students">follow along here</a>.</p>
  
                <h2>Version control is...</h2>

		<p>... inferior to keeping track of projects through email attachments.</p>

                <h2><br>Cloning a repository...</br></h2>
				<p><b>Requirements...<b><p>
				<ul> 
					<ol> On the right side, look for the clone URL directly under the settings button.</ol>
					<ol>Copy that to the clipboard</ol>
					<ol>Open a terminal (Git Bash or the Command Prompt if you're using Windows) and navigate to the directory you wish to clone to</ol>
					<ol> Once you're at the direction, type into the terminal: "git clone " (including the spaces, but not including the quotation marks)</ol>
					<ol>Use your terminal to "paste" the URL in. (Make sure it starts with https; if not, you'll need to use an ssh key and most students probably won't have a key already set up)</ol>
					<ol>terminal should now look something like this:</ol>
					<ol><b> git clone https://github.com/ "rest of clone url"<b></ol>
					<ol>Press enter to do the "git clone" operation.</ol>
					<ol>Once you've done that, "cd" into the directory.</ol>
				</ul>
				

		<p>... is leading us into war.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)">The Clone Wars</a>, that is.</p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

		<p>... you just said three things that all mean the same thing.</p>

                <h2>You need to fork when...</h2>

		<p>... you're out of spoons.</p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                adjective way to apply your skills to adjective projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another noun, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of nouns collaborating across noun and noun, and
                this event specially welcomes nouns to that style
                of noun.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                noun skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
